        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Answer- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects and classes. It allows developers to model real-world entities using code. OOP helps in organizing complex programs by structuring them into reusable and interactive objects. It follows four key principles:\n",
        "->Encapsulation (hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts)\n",
        "->Abstraction (simplifying complex systems by showing only relevant details)\n",
        "->Inheritance (allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class)\n",
        "->Polymorphism (enabling a single interface to be used for different implementations)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the properties and behavior of the objects. A class does not occupy memory until an object is created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in Python:\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, brand, model):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def display_info(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object of the class\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "car1.display_info()\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific attributes and behaviors. Each object created from a class has its own copy of attributes but shares the methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")  # car1 is an object of class Car\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\")  # car2 is another object\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, car1 and car2 are objects that belong to the Car class, but they hold different values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Answer- Abstraction vs. Encapsulation\n",
        "->Abstraction is about hiding unnecessary details and showing only what’s important. It helps you focus on what an object does rather than how it works. For example, when you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals without needing to know how the engine functions internally. In programming, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "->Encapsulation is about protecting data by restricting direct access to it. It ensures that data can only be accessed through specific methods, making it more secure and controlled. Think of it like a TV remote—you can press buttons to control the TV, but you cannot directly change its internal wiring. In coding, encapsulation is done using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Encapsulation in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance  # Controlled access\n",
        "\n",
        "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "print(account.get_balance())  # Valid access\n",
        "# print(account.__balance)  # This will cause an error (encapsulated)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Dunder (Double UnderScore) methods, also called magic methods, are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (). These methods allow customization of object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common dunder methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "_init_() – Constructor, initializes an object\n",
        "\n",
        "_str_() – Returns a string representation of an object\n",
        "\n",
        "_len_() – Defines behavior for len()\n",
        "\n",
        "_add_() – Defines behavior for the + operator\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Book:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, title, author):\n",
        "        self.title = title\n",
        "        self.author = author\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def _str_(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Book: {self.title} by {self.author}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "book1 = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\")\n",
        "print(book1)  # Calls _str_()\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Answer- Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "1. Single Inheritance – One child inherits from one parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Multiple Inheritance – A child inherits from multiple parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Multilevel Inheritance – A child inherits from a parent, which itself is a child of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from one parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Single Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"This animal makes a sound.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "d = Dog()\n",
        "d.speak()  # Output: Dog barks.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass. It enables one interface to be used for multiple functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Polymorphism:\n",
        "class Bird:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bird chirps.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cat meows.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "animals = [Bird(), Cat()]\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    animal.speak()  # Calls the appropriate method based on object type\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:\n",
        "->Public (self.name): Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "->Protected (self._name): Can be accessed within the class and subclasses.\n",
        "->Private (self.__name): Cannot be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Employee:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, name, salary):\n",
        "        self.name = name  # Public\n",
        "        self.__salary = salary  # Private\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_salary(self):\n",
        "        return self.__salary  # Access through a method\n",
        "\n",
        "emp = Employee(\"Alice\", 50000)\n",
        "print(emp.name)  # Accessible\n",
        "print(emp.get_salary())  # Accessing private variable via method\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Answer- A constructor is a special method (_init_()) used to initialize an object’s attributes when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "s = Student(\"John\", 21)\n",
        "print(s.name, s.age)\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Class Method (@classmethod): Works on the class level and takes cls as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method (@staticmethod): Does not depend on class or instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    species = \"Human\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_species(cls):\n",
        "        return cls.species\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def greet():\n",
        "        print(\"Hello!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(Person.get_species())  # Class method\n",
        "Person.greet()  # Static method\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, it is achieved using default arguments or *args.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class MathOperations:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "math = MathOperations()\n",
        "print(math.add(5))  # Uses default values\n",
        "print(math.add(5, 10, 15))  # All arguments passed\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Parent:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Parent class method.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Child(Parent):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Child class method.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Child()\n",
        "c.show()  # Calls the overridden method\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Answer- The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name\n",
        "\n",
        "p = Person(\"John\")\n",
        "print(p.name)  # Access without parentheses\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It promotes code reusability, flexibility, and scalability by enabling the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types). It is implemented in Python through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Answer- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It is defined using the ABC module and must have at least one abstract method, which is declared using @abstractmethod. Subclasses must implement all abstract methods of the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Answer- Encapsulation: Protects data from unauthorized access.\n",
        "->Inheritance: Promotes code reusability.\n",
        "->Polymorphism: Allows different classes to use the same interface.\n",
        "->Abstraction: Hides implementation details and exposes only relevant features.\n",
        "->Modularity: Makes code easier to maintain and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Answer- Class Variable: Shared among all instances of the class and defined at the class level.\n",
        "->Instance Variable: Unique to each instance and defined inside the constructor (_init_ method).\n",
        "\n",
        "class Example:\n",
        "    class_var = \"I am a class variable\"  # Class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def _init_(self, value):\n",
        "        self.instance_var = value  # Instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means the child class gets access to the attributes and methods of all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def method_A(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "Answer- _str_: Returns a user-friendly string representation of an object (used when calling print(obj)).\n",
        "\n",
        "_repr_: Returns an official string representation of an object that can ideally be used to recreate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def _init_(self, name, age):\n",

        "print(repr(p))  # Calls _repr_\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "Answer- The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class. It helps in avoiding redundant code and supports multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "class Parent:\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
